### The CyPSi Lab at the Institute of Informatics and Communication (IIC) offers an opportunity to be at the forefront of R&D in CPS & allied disciplines and collaborate with research groups worldwide to deal with real life challenges. The research outcomes are further developed as products by PnS groups, promoting entrepreneurship and delivery to intended audiences.

### The lab, established in 1999, throughout its rich history of pioneer research, has contributed to a wide range of domains from Educational Technologies to Cyber Physical Systems. 

# RESEARCH DOMAINS

## Human Centered Systems

>Cyberization is ubiquitous. Technology-driven engineering systems have a significant presence in almost all spheres of life. They are evolving at an alacritous pace in AI, computational capacities, and the scope of use with each passing year. On the one hand, they offer numerous benefits to society, yet a tone of concern emerges. The current state of cyberization is creating an intellectual challenge to envision, design, and research Human-Centered Systems for the future. Human-centered systems orchestrate CPS with various social units â€“ organizations, communities, and distinctive social processes and practices. Thus, making them more livable, usable, and sustainable are the significant research challenges we have taken up at our lab.

## Healthcare

>The demand for remote healthcare is getting crucial than ever, and CPSs have made spectacular advancements in this sector. It is piloting technologies and software to address challenging healthcare issues and revolutionize how myriad healthcare issues are tackled. The CPS healthcare ecosystem has evolved in telemedicine, connected-health, mobile-health, and intelligent health in the last two decades. The healthcare-Cyber Physical Systems (H-CPS) networks are available anywhere, anytime, and by anyone. Yet, they are to be rigorously explored and are a matter of high research interest.

## Cybersecurity
>CPSs are closely integrated physical processes, networking, computation, feedback loops and comprise several tiny devices with sensing, computing, and wireless communication capabilities. The tremendously enhanced functionality, automation, and connectivity also bring significant cybersecurity challenges to the CPS. Moreover, the extensive connectivity makes a CPS vulnerable to cyber threats and attacks, making safety, security and privacy essential research issues.

## Wearables
>The recent spectacular progress in Sensor technologies, Materials, IoT, ICT, and microelectronic fabrication techniques created a significant stimulus towards the development of smart wearable devices. As a result, this sector is witnessing explosive growth, offering huge market and research opportunities. As wearable devices are complex systems of sensors, cross-domain communication networks, handling large amounts of data with real-time decision-making capabilities. In addition, they provide continuous autonomous service over a long period. Therefore, rigorous research in computing and design technologies is needed to adequately overcome the challenges to satisfy the stringent demands of wearable devices.
